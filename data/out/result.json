Looking at the list of <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/autograph-identification?sort=newest\">recent autograph identification questions<\/a>, we can see that basically all of them are either being downvoted, closed or both. This implies to me that they're not working very well as a category of questions here.<\/p>\n\n<p>I see two major problems with these questions:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The questions often don't have enough detail to let us answer them: they're often just \"I've got this baseball, who signed it?\". Given the number of baseball players there have been, the community is closing these as \"too broad\".<\/li>\n<li>This sort of question generally doesn't give any value to future readers: even if we do manage to identify one signature, reading that question doesn't really help the next person who wants to identify a signature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>On the other hand, these questions are relatively popular here in terms of number of questions asked, and we're not exactly overwhelmed with questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>So: should autograph identification questions be on-topic here?<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>CONCLUSION<\/strong>: As the Sports Stack Exchange moderation team, we feel there is sufficient consensus here, both among the community and the moderation team themselves, to declare autograph identification questions off-topic.

However I don’t think this is a real issue for the following reasons<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rules questions are inherently relevant to the participants of the sports.<\/li>\n<li>Questions on advanced metrics can be relevant to participants and are certainly relevant to the business side of sports which should be covered in the scope.<\/li>\n<li>Questions about things like fantasy sports, trivia and other fan activities (like watching sports, visiting venues etc) are still a question that will have to be dealt with, but it makes for far fewer scope issues than either site currently has.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This merger makes sense and without it both sites are going to continue to have the same issues they currently have. Issues I believe are hurting both sites. Sports.SE’s existence continues the perception issues Fitness is struggling with and there is no sense in having two sites with the same scope without some kind of distinction that goes beyond the arbitrary and confusing guidelines that are currently in place.<\/p>\n",

This is clearly not good as it makes it rather difficult to get more information on the subject or even check an answer. Almost all content licenses on the web - including the one used by <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.stackoverflow.com\/2010\/08\/defending-attribution-required\/\">SE itself<\/a> - requires a proper attribution for all quotes (if they allow you to quote at all - see below).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><p>In some cases, the quoted text is not marked as such, and readers can be in doubt whether the content is original. I believe this is something everybody would object to.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><p>The quoted text is more or less similar to some existing text. How similar an answer can be to some existing text is basically a copyright question. And given the number of copyright cases worldwide, it is probably safest to either include a strait unaltered quote or rewrite the material completely.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><p>The content is copyrighted. This is a fussy situation as there are certain <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fair_use\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fair Use<\/a> rules. Although these rules differs between countries and depends on the type of content (e.g. facts or results versus prose or description), it is usually safe to quote smallers parts in answers - as long as you have a proper attribution for the quote. Also see <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.meta.stackexchange.com\/q\/131\/38\">Is there a guideline to quoting from copyrighted rule books?<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

      "Body": "<p>This is just an idea to engage the community and highlight the highest voted and most viewed questions of 2016 on Sports SE. This is similar to when we used to have <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.meta.stackexchange.com\/search?tab=newest&amp;q=self-evaluation\">self-evaluations<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>In March, NCAA \"<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">March Madness<\/a>\" takes over the college basketball world. In <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.stackexchange.com\/rooms\/2433\/the-clubhouse\/\">The Clubhouse<\/a>, we enter a competition among ourselves to see who can produce the best bracket (a sample bracket is shown below). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/xxw4B.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/xxw4B.jpg\" alt=\"a sample bracket\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Taking that concept, I wonder if we can take the 16 highest voted questions and the 16 most viewed questions of 2016 and insert them into a bracket against each other. Most likely, there will be overlap, so it's more like the 16 highest voted questions and the 16 most viewed questions that aren't in the highest voted category. I'm not sure if we commingle them or place them separately (a highest voted division and a most viewed division).<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, we can take one week per round in order to give our users plenty of time to cast their vote (probably through comments rather than up\/down vote - one vote per user). An exception will be the quarterfinal round, which will take two weeks (so that we have no more than 8 matchups per voting round). With my currently proposed bracket, this would take 5 weeks (if we start the last week of February, this coincides with the conclusion of March Madness in the beginning of April):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Feb 27 - Mar 5: Quarterfinal round - highest voted division<\/li>\n<li>Mar 6 - Mar 12: Quarterfinal round - most viewed division<\/li>\n<li>Mar 13 - Mar 19: Sweet 16<\/li>\n<li>Mar 20 - Mar 26: Elite 8<\/li>\n<li>Mar 27 - Apr 2: Final 4<\/li>\n<li>Apr 3 - Apr 9: Championship<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Not only will we identify a \"question of the year,\" but we can also provide votes and answers to questions that may have gone unnoticed in a user's eyes. Again, this is just a concept, so any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The highest voted questions can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/search?tab=votes&amp;q=created%3a2016%20is%3aq\">here<\/a>. The most viewed questions can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/search?tab=votes&amp;q=created%3a2016%20is%3aq%20views%3a740\">here<\/a>. <strike>In the event of a tiebreaker for highest voted (I count 16 questions at +11 or more), I was thinking of choosing based on least viewed among the questions at +11 (as some +11 questions will qualify for the most viewed category). The questions that don't make it in the highest voted category, if applicable, can be inserted into the most viewed category.<\/strike> 16 questions at +11 or more works perfectly for my proposed bracket.<\/p>\n",

      "Body": "<p>So there are a few users on here that have some really good knowledge about certain sports.   You get pretty good quality answers - these guys are generally coaches or referees in their respective sports and honestly most of the really knowledgeable people don't have a lot of answers on here.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are a few users on the site that you can tell (by their comments and secondary information) that have little to no expertise on the questions they are answering.   Their answers vary from not right at all, to kind of right but totally missing the point.<\/p>\n<p>These same users will down vote good answers that aren't theirs (I have tested this out multiple times with multiple accounts - I do not have multiple accounts, another user helped me test this and it was very easy to test).   Then they will answer the same question with something close to what was downvoted - and sometimes it is funny that they will answer it (googling things but then misinterpret most of the facts to the point the answer is wrong).<\/p>\n<p>This never gets fixed and we have a large degree of answers on this site that range from bad to wrong - these have upvotes and are accepted.   What is also telling is that I belong to a couple of officiating forums - basketball and football - and there is a general disdain on those sites for this site.   These are users that have no idea I even post on this site, and they basically treat this site as nothing - or answers from kids.<\/p>\n<p>So the DIY SE site has a lot of answers from contractors, electricians and builders.   The mathematics site has a lot of answers from teachers, professors, and engineers.    Where does this site get it answers from?<\/p>\n<p>A big problem on this site is the moderation.   The mods only involvement are to enforce &quot;play nice&quot; rules.   On other SE sites if there are poor answers the mods step in and comment or try to encourage site to have good answers.   Here the mods allow a small group to up and downvote answers to fill their tally - we all know it is going on.<\/p>\n<p>So &quot;play nice&quot; is only for those with the maturity to directly discuss things on the site, not for the people in the background working passive-aggressively.   Good job SE and mods!!!  It looks like the robotic rules do not work with a small captive user base.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need examples?   How many do you want?   Do you want me to just name names?   Are the mods\/SE happy with a site that is this poor and has so many misinformed answers?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Example:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/24334\/why-do-teams-leave-4-seconds-for-a-field-goal-attempt\">Why do teams leave ~4 seconds for a field goal attempt<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The accepted answer is wrong - categorically.   There has never been a timeout in upper level college or pro football in the past 30 years with 4 seconds or less on the clock after trying to attempt a live kick.   The answer reeks of - let me think this one out - not actual football knowledge.   He even said that the kicker\/holder can spike the ball.   What?   That is grounding.      Upvoted\/accepted.   My correct answer downvoted.   How is the site not a joke to new users?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Older Examples:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/24329\/basketball-blocking-and-catching-shots\/24340#24340\">Basketball - Blocking and Catching Shots<\/a> - Accepted answer ABSOLUTELY WRONG - common knowledge wrong.   My small kids know that a block gathered is a block and rebound on stat sheet.    Someone writes another answer to support mine, a mode edits it, yet that mod doesn't delete it as a duplicate, the same mod doesn't ask for a print of the rules for the answer, yet that mod downvotes mine and asks for rules - and then when I add the rule references, no comment from mod!  That's our mods in a nutshell!!!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/22992\/is-a-hard-slap-to-the-basketball-a-foul\/24101#24101\">Is a hard slap to the basketball a foul?<\/a> - A right answer by me downvoted by three users and two users that are referees commenting on why would this be downvoted.   Notice how these two guys, who are referees, don't answer many questions on the site?   Why would they?  Wait were the favorable comments deleted?   Why yes they were.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>And might as well shut the site down because it is way less accurate than Wikipedia Example:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/1623\/does-the-defense-have-to-defend-the-extra-point\/24536#24536\">Does the defense have to defend the extra point?<\/a>  - 7 years and an absolute wrong answer has 15 upvotes.   No mods commenting about the wrong answer.   During those 7 years this has played out multiple times with the NFL referees making the defense get back on the field.<\/p>\n<p>Update:  Really odd that none of the mods on this site have wrote an answer about any of my examples.   This has been open for a month and zero from the mods....  Yea I quit answering questions on the site too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New Update: After reviewing the questions again I have noticed that any comment that agrees with my answers on these questions or supports them have been serially deleted.   Does anyone think that behavior is normal.  I have also had to flag a mod multiple times on this question for defaming me.<\/strong><\/p>\n",

Thanks to the Stack Exchange staff who have covered some of the workload in the meantime.<\/p>\n\n<p>The significant change since moderators were last appointed in this community is that we've \"graduated\", which means that moderators are elected rather than appointed by Stack Exchange. As such, Stack Exchange are looking at scheduling an election; I've titled this post \"Q2 2020\" but that's indicative rather than anything else - the exact timing will depend on the workload of the appropriate Stack Exchange staff. To avoid finding ourselves in a situation where an election would fail due to an insufficient number of candidates, though, I'm posting this to try to assess the community members' willingness to step up and nominate themselves, when the actual election's nomination period starts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please leave an answer if you'd be willing to run for a moderator position, should we decide to run an election. Like I mentioned, we're looking at scheduling the nomination period to start some time in Q2 2020.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This is not an official election nomination thread, just a \"pulse check\" to get a notion of how many people here would be willing to step up, so you don't have to put up your whole election nomination. <\/p>\n",

      "Body": "<p>This particular SE site is putting along but doesn't look like picking up the kind of traffic it would need to graduate from beta any time soon. One problem with fitting 'sports' into the SE model is that as far as the observers of sport go, as opposed to participants, the kind of questions you really want to ask\/answer\/discuss would be considered either off topic or too subjective. Questions about participating in sport are in the minority at the moment and not the topic of this question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take for instance my main topic of interest here, cricket. If you look at the last dozen or two cricket questions asked, each question taken on it's own is reasonable, but taken as a whole are a pretty bland and uninteresting collection, mainly covering either very simple well known rules or obscure edges cases in the rules. If a cricket fan comes to this site somehow via a search engine and pokes around at the questions, they are unlikely to be particularly motivated to become engaged with the site. Note that this is true more or less for many of the other questions. Football and American Football seems to be somewhat stronger, but still the kind of interesting questions people love discussing in the pub just aren't here, and nor could they given the SE Q&amp;A model.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main issue is subjectivity. Questions about sport that are entirely objective are typically about either the rules or some statistic that could be relatively easily found on some standard site or via search engines. In a lot of cases they just aren't that interesting to a sports fan.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is precedent at some other SE sites to have tag categories like 'soft question' to indicate a question somewhat outside the core intent of the sites scope. Would something like that work here, some kind of tag to indicate the question is somewhat subjective and up for discussion, rather than being on the face of it definitively answerable?<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a slippery slope here, SE is not a forum and by relaxing standards the boundaries become much less defined and puts more load on mods and high rep users to ensure consistent standards are applied to closing questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>To give an example, the following is an example question (about cricket) that I think would on current standards would rightly be closed. However, I think it is an example of a case where good and interesting answers might be generated with some limited but not open ended subjectivity. What do people think?<\/p>\n\n<p>Sample question:<\/p>\n\n<p>Why is Peter Siddle considered to be a Test Match specialist?<\/p>\n\n<p>Peter Siddle is currently considered to be the leader of the bowling attack in Test matches for Australia, however is never considered for any limited overs cricket. Is this entirely due to the selectors wanting to keep him fit and rested for Test matches, or is there something about his bowling style that makes him unsuitable for white ball cricket, even though he is considered the leading red ball bowler? In an ideal world where we could ignore the needs for player rest and rotation, would Siddle have a place in Australia's best ODI or T20 team?<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what does the community think? This may not be the best question as a sample, as there is also a strong time localisation to it. On the other hand, subjective questions about relative player or team abilities typically will have time localisation (which is another reason they would most likely be closed on current standards). <\/p>\n",

In <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/a\/16499\/11439\">my answer<\/a> I exposed some relevant results using the code block format so I could emphasize the drama of the scores:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>Micronesia  0 - 30 Tahiti       3 July 2015\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n<pre><code>Micronesia  0 - 38 Fiji         5 July 2015\nVanuatu    46 -  0 Micronesia   7 July 2015\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>However, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/posts\/16499\/revisions\">edited later on<\/a> to leave it like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Micronesia  0 - 30 Tahiti       3 July 2015<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Micronesia  0 - 38 Fiji         5 July 2015<\/li>\n<li>Vanuatu    46 -  0 Micronesia   7 July 2015<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then this discussion followed:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please do not use codeblock for anything that is not actual code. – Nij<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@Nij there are cases where it helps showing the info better. This was one. – fedorqui<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Codeblock does not present information more clearly than either a quoteblock, a list, emphasis, or some combination of them.

Your revision made the post look worse than better in my opinion. Once I am back in a desktop computer I'll try to fix the format. – fedorqui<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@Nij see for example classifications in the IAAF page: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iaaf.org\/competitions\/iaaf-world-championships\/15th-iaaf-world-championships-4875\/results\/men\/marathon\/final\/result#resultheader\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iaaf.org\/competitions\/iaaf-world-championships\/…<\/a> They tend to use this kind of format. Since <a href=\"https:\/\/stackexchange.com\/\">Stack Exchange<\/a> does not allow tables, codeblock is the most similar format to show such pieces of info.

Since we very seldom need to refer to any of those things on ELL, it should be very rarely used. Similarly, <strong>there's little reason to use preformatted\/code blocks, except for things like types of poetry that rely on line spacing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Which was also stated <a href=\"https:\/\/english.meta.stackexchange.com\/a\/54\/37429\">in English Language &amp; Usage Meta<\/a>:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It can be useful, for instance, when you are quoting poems which may use special indentations, using several spaces. In the simple HTML this editor allows, &quot;several spaces&quot; are not easily done.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>And then in <a href=\"https:\/\/english.meta.stackexchange.com\/a\/3359\/37429\">Should we fix backticks?<\/a> someone said:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am against. For one thing, I really need code formatting sometimes, as in Proto-Indo-European roots, where Markup (or what is it called?—asterisks and such) messes up my words. Then there are other uses. There is no serious problem (just looks) and removing any kind of functionality will not only mess up older questions but also limit what we can do, in both foreseen and unforeseen ways, as above.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This gives us the idea to get Nij's formatting right:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Micronesia  0 - 30 Tahiti       3 July 2015<\/li>\n<li>Micronesia  0 - 38 Fiji         5 July 2015<\/li>\n<li>Vanuatu    46 -  0 Micronesia   7 July 2015<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Which needs some terrible formatting-fu:<\/p>\n<pre><code>* Micronesia&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 - 30 Tahiti&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 July 2015\n* Micronesia&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 - 38 Fiji&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 July 2015\n* Vanuatu&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 - &amp;nbsp;0 Micronesia&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 July 2015\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Also, following the example on IAAF's results I mention in the exposed comments, in <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/a\/15976\/11439\">my answer<\/a> to <em>Did an athlete lap the rest of the runners after an illness that left him in bed for a long time before the competition?<\/em> I used the same formatting and cannot think in any that serves the purpose better:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1946_European_Athletics_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_10,000_metres\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oslo 1946 - 10,000 metres<\/a>.

If fact, the only comment my question got was a quote from the FAQ that is still under debate at this point for this beta SE site (see <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.meta.stackexchange.com\/questions\/210\/reflect-our-actual-scope-in-the-faq\">Reflect our actual scope in the FAQ<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't mind if my question is closed for being off topic for this site, but the reason for being off topic should be clearly stated in the FAQ.  I am more interested in discussing the scope of this site and what is on topic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, speaking more generally, does this site really want to forbid questions about the visual recordings of individual and team sports?  What about other forms of documenting sports?  For example, would it be off topic to ask if anyone has a reference for the box score of the final game in the first baseball world series? I think such a question should be on topic.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Again, I emphasize that the reason for this meta question is to help this site <em>clearly<\/em> define its scope.  If that scope excludes question like mine, that is fine with me.  I think this site has the potential to become bigger than most of the other SE sites.<\/p>\n",

      "Body": "<p>The question below was closed, and probably correctly according to our FAQ (although I'm not sure what \"source\" exactly means).  I'd like to open a discussion over whether questions like this should be on topic.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/UhFkl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/UhFkl.png\" alt=\"The type of question in question.\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some background (skip to the end if this is too long!):<\/p>\n\n<p>Statistics in sports is a very hot topic right now; FiveThirtyEight, Football Outsiders, and their ilk are some of the most popular sports sites this side of, well, ESPN.  Assuming this site intends to cover sports-as-fans and not just sports-as-participants (which is a valid question, I think!), it seems obvious that some discussions of statistics must be on topic here; and certainly some questions are, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/11877\/baseball-and-dwar\">this question about dWAR<\/a> which wasn't really a very well written question but still was certainly on-topic and generated one very good answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, questions about <em>specific<\/em> statistics - \"who holds the record for...\" - are not really <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.meta.stackexchange.com\/questions\/12\/how-should-we-handle-questions-whose-answers-change-often\/13#13\">great on topic questions<\/a>, as this isn't really a very good place to host things like that - although we've tended not to shut them down, either, and the harder ones seem like reasonable questions.  However, in particular ones that might change frequently tend to be worse fits here, because of that fact - the answer becomes out of date but still is in our database and someone has to realize it's out of date to fix it.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This leaves, however, questions like the one that started this: questions about sources of information.  These fall into two broad categories:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Questions about finding a source for a specific statistic, such as \"I remember a game back in 1956 where Ernie Banks pitched in the seventh inning.\"  <\/li>\n<li>Questions about how to, in general, do research, including good sources for information.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>1 should be off-topic as it's written; StackExchange isn't about asking someone to do research for you, it's about tapping people's already existing knowledge.  However, it can be rewritten:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How do you identify a specific game that a position player pitched in the 1950s?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a very specific question, and should be on-topic.  (The 1950s is important, as different eras have different kinds of information available.)  Part of the answer to that question, though, would lead us to 2.<\/p>\n\n<p>2 is basically what the initial question from this discussion is about: about how one can <em>do<\/em> research.  It seems to me that the general topic - of how to do research - should clearly be on-topic; questions about sources for research are however more of a question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Should we change the rules (or our interpretation) to allow questions about where to find statistics to be on topic?  And if so, precisely where is the line drawn?<\/p>\n",

      "Body": "<p>I've been thinking a lot about this lately, and honestly I'm quite conflicted.<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel that any sport that really is a sport should be on topic here, regardless of it is on topic on another site. Overlap is fine. So the real question is, are e-sports sports?<\/p>\n\n<p>E-sports is essentially glorified computer gaming. Instead of someone shooting hoops 16 hours a day to be a pro, they play a game (like Starcraft 2) for 16 hours a day.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the average athlete will tell you that gaming is about the most nonathletic thing you can do. I would contend for the casual gamer this is true. However professional gamers require great agility, coordination, and endurance to excel at their gaming. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In Starcraft gamers are often clocked at performing over 400 actions per minute. That's over 6 per second, consistently.<\/li>\n<li>There are specific exercises pro gamers do to increase their agility, reduce repetitive strain injuries, and go for longer periods without a break.<\/li>\n<li>Pro gamers practice mouse movements to achieve perfect mousing (that is, they aim to stop their mouse on the exact pixel they intend to) to prevent misclicks which can cost them the game.<\/li>\n<li>There are athletic similarities between pro gaming and something like Table Tennis (which I imagine most would agree IS a sport). Consider the paddle to be like the mouse, and the spin\/angle to be like the key-hand (pro gamers use a \"mousing hand\" and a \"keyboarding hand\").<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now it would seem that perhaps we might be tempted to say \"If the question pertains to the athletic component, then perhaps it would be allowed, but the gaming component would not be allowed\". But if that's the case, then what about a question about the Tampa Two defense? The athletics of defenders is merely an means by which they achieve their goal of fulfilling the strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm sure I could come up with more rational arguments for why it should be allowed. And yet, I find myself unable to flat out say that e-sports would be on topic here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing I've considered is audience: is the audience that's likely to be on this site going to be able to answer expert level questions about e-sports? My initial thought is probably not. If people are brought to the site as a result of e-sports questions, are they likely to stay? Again, probably not.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I remain 100% convinced that e-sports are indeed sports. I feel they meet the criteria. But at the same time, I feel they shouldn't be considered on topic. But then that violates the principle that we accept all sports.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I open it up to the community for some input.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n",

Your site will be publicly visible on Wednesday afternoon. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, before your move forward, I wanted to point out a few things that concerned us.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A number of questions look like general reference.<\/strong> We've noticed that there are a number of questions concerning the rules of various sporting activities, or basic sporting history. These things are what we would consider \"general reference,\" in that they're easily searched for on Google, or are found in Wikipedia with minimal effort. We <em>strongly<\/em> discourage questions like this! They don't make a site look good, and they yield more novice-level questions, which in turn won't attract experts. <\/li>\n<li><strong>The site's audience is unclear.<\/strong> This is possibly partially the fault of the Community Team, but there is a need here for the community to decide who is wanted on here: do you want the athletes themselves, the experts at <em>performing<\/em> in an athletic event? Super-fans of a sport, the type who obsessively track statistics and argue about which third string rookie player is superior, the kinds who watch every minute of every draft and game and highlight reel? Casual armchair fans, who watch major games and know the bare minimum of a sport? Coaches, who mentor and train and help hone a player \/ athlete to peak performance?  All of them -- and if so, is that realistic and\/or viable? There's a number of ways this site could pan out; it's important that the community set the tone for the audience early on -- now! -- while the site is new and malleable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There is a degree of overlap with Fitness.SE.<\/strong> This is the lowest-priority issue on this list, but it's something I feel is important to be aware of moving forward. The \"line\" between Fitness and Sports will likely never be demarcated in a distinct and obvious way. However, as we move into public beta, the community must work to make a larger distinction between the sites. Specifics and grey areas will be worked out on a case-by-case basis, but the site's <em>focus<\/em> and target audience should be made distinct from Fitness. Effectively, this concern relies on the previous two.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Be cognizant of these issues moving forward. And, once more, congratulations on making it to public beta!

After that, August 2016 (during the Summer Olympics in Brazil) and July 2017 (don't know of a major sporting events) had the most engagement.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FIFA World Cup is one of the main sporting events in the world and from the above we can see it generates the most engagement which coincidentally should result in traffic for us.

If the original poster felt compelled enough to ask the question in the first place, then it is notable to him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>I had asked &quot;Who decides what is notable?&quot; and had attempted to interpret what is &quot;notable,&quot; but I still have not come to a conclusion on those inquires. My interpretation, based on comments below, says matches at high levels of sport is what is notable.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If a specific incident does not have some notability, it is unlikely to be useful to other readers unless framed generally. However, if it is rare or controversial, this may get around the notability requirements... if it doesn't involve a team in the highest national league of a country, or a first-international team, I will generally vote to close.&quot;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Notability and notability requirements are mentioned here but are not defined. I looked at the <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.meta.stackexchange.com\/a\/531\">accepted answer<\/a> and it appears notable = rare or controversial. Which leaves &quot;notable in some other way&quot; as something that is unclear to me, though I have inquired about it multiple times.<\/p>\n<p>I find this unfair to those at lower-levels of sport as they are the demographic that is most likely to seek help on this site. Moreover, officiating is generally universal save nuances with a given league\/level of sport. See <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/20315\/why-does-a-basketball-ref-raise-the-second-arm-when-a-3-pt-shot-falls\">this question<\/a> for a great example of such.

Lack of ruleset and footage also makes the question more prone to opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Unclear what is being asked &quot;as it is about a specific situation without giving us enough info about it: 'Would you have called it?' - 'Called what?

I, personally, think that country name tags are efficient and add value to the community: it can attract relatively new users\/motivate old ones to answer the questions about the sports in the countries they are familiar with.<\/p>\n\n<p>It can also help to correctly tag some questions, e.g: we have Spanish <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/la-liga\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;la-liga&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">la-liga<\/a> tag, but we currently have 4 questions about Spanish Copa del Rey (<a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17731\/would-the-copa-del-rey-change-its-name-for-a-queen\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17700\/how-many-yellow-cards-before-player-is-suspended-in-copa-del-rey\">2<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4008\/where-will-the-copa-del-rey-final-2014-be-played\">3<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4076\/suspension-across-spanish-competitions\">4<\/a>) without <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/copa-del-rey\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;copa-del-rey&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">copa-del-rey<\/a> tag, which can be organized under <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/spain\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;spain&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">spain<\/a> tag.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there's a <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/english-premier-league\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;english-premier-league&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">english-premier-league<\/a> tag, but we don't have tags for <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/english-fa-cup\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;english-fa-cup&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">english-fa-cup<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/english-league-cup\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;english-league-cup&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">english-league-cup<\/a>, which can be gathered under one <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/england\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;england&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">england<\/a> tag.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can think of many scenarios where country name tags may be useful. I also understand that if we give it a go, we should define a universal tag wiki template for country name tags and then use it to write specific tag wikis for each new country name tag. <\/p>\n\n<p>Please add your thoughts on how country name tags can help you in the sports you are interested in (as I'm mainly dealing with <a href=\"https:\/\/sports.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/football\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;football&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">football<\/a>) or tell us why do you think it is not useful.<\/p>\n",

However, after the match, with multiple camera angles, replays, etc, it's often a lot more clear cut what happened, and it may be possible to make a mostly objective assessment as to whether the decision was correct, and if not, what the correct course of action may be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if we can remove the \"primarily opinion-based\" hurdle, are these questions then at risk of being \"too localised\"? I'd argue for high profile matches in a given sport, which are of interest to the majority of followers of that sport, these questions are certainly not too localised, as they're of interest to a wide range of people.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to sum up, are questions regarding specific match official decisions in a particular game on topic? If your answer is not a clear-cut, yes-no answer, which are allowed and which are not?<\/p>\n",
